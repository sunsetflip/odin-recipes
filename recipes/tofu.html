                <li>3½ oz (100g) pork tenderloin (optional)</li>
                <li>3 leeks or scallions</li>
                <li>¾ cup plus 2 tbsp (200ml) cooking oil</li>
                <li>2 tbsp chili bean paste</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced</li>
                <li>1 tbsp chopped ginger</li>
                <li>¾ cup plus 2 tbsp (200ml) stock</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tsp potato starch, mixed with 4 tsp cold water</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="instructions">
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the tofu into 2-inch (5 cm) squares, about 1/2-inch (1 cm) thick.</li>
                <li>Thinly slice the pork, if using. Cut leeks/scallions into lengths, keeping the white and green parts separate.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a wok over high heat until sizzling hot. Fry the tofu slices in a few batches until golden. Remove and let dry on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Carefully pour off all but 3 tbsp of the oil from the wok and return to high heat. Add the pork, if using, and stir briskly to separate the slices.</li>
                <li>Turn down the heat to medium, then add the chili bean paste and stir-fry until the oil is red and richly fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the garlic and ginger, along with the leek/scallion whites, and also fry until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Pour in stock, add tofu slices, and bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Turn down the heat slightly, season with sugar and soy sauce and let simmer for 3-4 minutes, until liquid has reduced.</li>
                <li>Add the leek/scallion greens and stir briefly until just cooked.</li>
                <li>Give the potato starch mixture a stir and add to the wok, in order to thicken the sauce until it clings to the tofu slices.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
